Place static UI assets (lottie files, example audio, images) in this folder. These files should be considered static and optionally served from a CDN in production.

- dragon.lottie — Lottie animation for the header
- temp_audio.mp3 — example audio (do not commit large recordings)

Note: large binary assets may be better stored in an S3 bucket for production deployments.
